Hi, I'm Ben, I'm a sophomore majoring in environmental studies. I don't really know what I want to do beyond college, but would love to work in conservation or do field work, and would also enjoy working in education, particularly Jewish education.
In my free time, I really like playing board, card and video games, like Hearthstone, Minecraft and Magic the Gathering, watching TV, hanging out with friends, and singing, mainly 70s, 80s and 90s rock and also show tunes and jewish songs.
