Major: Environmental Studies
Potential Careers: I don't know anything cool that lets me explore new things
I took this course because it looked interesting  and hopefully would help me learn new skills
In my free time I do a lot of singing, especially Jewish songs, and really enjoy playing board and video games. Some of my favorites are Magic: The Gathering, Lost Cities, Hearthstone and Minecraft.
